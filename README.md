# rflexa

rflexa is a complete, Python based, receiver function workflow tool, with the purpose of assisting the observational seismologist *from station to subsurface*. Although initially built for receiver function analysis, the individual modules can be extracted for use and integrated into your existing workflow.

## Getting Started
As stated in the introduction, rflexa is Python based. This guide is not intended to be a complete introduction to Python, but if you are new to the Python programming language I highly recommend you go through the following steps before continuing any further with rflexa:

1. Install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) package manager.  
2. Depending on how you prefer to write code, do one of the following:  
  * If you like to work from the command-line/terminal, read about setting up [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) to work from the command-line.  
  * If you like to work within an IDE, search Google for a tutorial on how to setup conda in your respective IDE. I recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac), as it is built entirely for Python development and comes with a thorough [conda setup guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html). The Community version is free and has been sufficient for my needs.

rflexa is built on top of the [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki/Installation-via-Anaconda) package, and requires that you have ObsPy installed in order to run properly. If you already have ObsPy installed, you can continue to the [next section](#Downloading-Earthquake-Data).
